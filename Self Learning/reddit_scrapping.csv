Campaign to give ZAB(Desk+School Bag) to students in Rural Karnataka,22,d0xuya,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0xuya/campaign_to_give_zabdeskschool_bag_to_students_in/,2,2019-09-08 05:37:46,"My name is LAASYA VENUGOPAL and I am in Grade 12 at the Candor International School, Bangalore.  


I have undertaken this campaign because I think education is the biggest variable for changing the lives of kids in govt school. In these schools, students lack everything from books to school bags. Further schools in rural areas lack basic educational infrastructure like a desk & chair.  


Most of the students in these schools sit down on the floor for long hours. Sitting on the floor and studying for 6-8 hours affects posture, resulting in back pain, poor eyesight makes it difficult to concentrate and study. I like the ZAB BAG as it solves the problem of a tough durable school bag and doubles as a school desk. The fact that raising 20000 INR or more can give a ZAB BAG (DESK+SCHOOL BAG) and transform the lives of 50 children or more is something that I am very excited about.

I am doing this crowdfunding campaign in partnership with the Wockhardt Foundation. They get the ZAB (DESK+SCHOOL BAG) manufactured through their vendors. Wockhardt Foundation identifies the schools and the students who would require the bag and delivers them to the school, thereby transforming the lives of students in rural areas.

Since Wockhardt Foundation is an NGO, any funding made to this campaign is eligible for tax exemption under 80G of IT Act 1961. In order to enable your 80G receipt to reach you without any hiccups, please ensure that you enter your name and contact information correctly. Foreign funding is also accepted.

Please support my campaign and let us together impact and improve the lives of these fellow students in govt schools in Karnataka. This will over time am sure result in better grades for these students as they will find sitting in a classroom is more enjoyable. 

You can visit the link given below for more information and pictures on how it works.

At the end joined a service based mnc company in Mumbai, as I was quite good with fundamentals i got 3-4 offer and joined the current one because they told me i will work as java developer and pay they offered is very less around 2.2 LPA and 2 years bond but i have to take it because i didn't have any option.
6. They Kept me on bench for 2 months, no training, no work and these things lead loosing whatever the confidence i had after that they said client requirements are changed and released me from the project, and i gave interview for internal transfer and they selected me in ecm department though i declined but the upper management abused me and told me that i have no option but to join the ecm department.
7. In ecm department they gave me basic training on ibm case manager tool, then for 1 month i have worked on jenkins tool but again they told me i have to work on ibm filenet tool, which i don't like as there is no coding involved in it and as far as i know there is no scope in it. I don't like the work and told the upper management that I won't work on such tool, and requested to give java related work and declined to sign service bond of 2 years and they told me they don't have any projects on java for me and mow sending me on client location and it's again very far from my home (client location is thane) and i told them I won't be able to go and I'm not interested in working on their tool.

Now i want switch from this company, because of low pay, 2 years bond and traveling takes around 4-4.5 hours the only reason i joined this company was to learn new technologies and also prepare for gate exam on weekends but nothing is working out as of now. I'm depressed, don't know what should i do, I'm not getting response from product based company because of gap and lack of experience. After working so hard, I think i fucked up badly and my peers and friends are doing very good in their respective fields and here I'm after 24 year trying to find my interest, please help me what should i do in such situations.",0.86,False
Indian Gaming Directory: The one stop shop for all Indian gamers to find each other to team up and win!,49,d0wzir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0wzir/indian_gaming_directory_the_one_stop_shop_for_all/,42,2019-09-08 04:28:10,"#**What:**

r/IndianGamingDirectory

#**Why:**

This sub is designed to tackle the specific issue of finding fellow gamers to team up and play your favorite games. /r/IndianGaming is mostly a discussion sub but the posts there to find players often get shoved down by other posts. This sub was made to address that problem and everyone can find players for any game and any platform they want to without the post being overtaken. 

No discussions or other posts are allowed. Only team/player requests.

#**How?**

Its easy. Subscribe and get flaired up for your favorite games. We will have players for every game available. Some of the biggest will be Rainbow 6, PUBG, Apex Legends, Fifa, Destiny 2, CSGO, Forza and Fortnite. But you might find players for almost any game you want. 

#**How can i help?**

For a new sub with a niche target, any and all subscriptions will help us. We are looking to become a sister sub to any India related subreddit.

Please note that this is a very unique sub because so far as we know, most games have their own subs to find players and there is no specific region based directory like this. But this sub is made to be a ""all in one roof"" thing. 

#**Is it only for India?**

Not exactly. NRI living anywhere in the world are also welcome and we also invite every other nation's gamers in the subcontinent and even China, Singapore, Thailand etc to join up because we mostly share a common server in most games. 


Thank you for taking the time to read. Please drop a sub and spread the word if possible. :)

PS: Please post to get players for your favorite game too :)",0.86,False

Following are the timelines of my process:

3rd September: Submitted application online, paid fees (₹400) and booked a time slot at the RTO.

4th September: Went to the RTO at the time slot I choose. There was a line at the counter where they verify the documents and then give you a token number for the next step where they click your picture and take signatures. All this took 1.5 hours max. 

7th September: Just recieved my new DL by courier. 

I'm genuinely impressed by this, process has been quite fast and efficient unlike what I had expected.

**The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus**

On The The Myth of Sisyphus: Although the book is only under 200 pages, this can be a little heavy read for some. It talks about many things, most importantly Absurdity, Suicide, and the meaning of life. These are big topics, and the fact that Camus is the one who tackled them makes them much big-ger! You need to really focus while reading these philosophical essays, and you need to be familiar with some existential and absurd philosophy to fully grasp the idea. Camus dissected Suicide's existential implications and wired the myth of Sisyphus's into works of Kafka, Goethe, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Remember, this is considered one of the most important works in Philosophy, and in Existential Philosophy. It's a fascinating insight into a thought provoking question, Albert Camus suggests that suicide amounts to a confession that life is not worth living. Camus tends to assume that, in the absence of God, there is no meaning of life, at least no superimposed, objective meaning of life. Thus, for him, the resulting absurdity is the starting point, not the result of a deductive process. If life is truly meaningless, the question is how to respond? Do we revert to the meaning of life posited by religion and a supernatural being (an irrational response)? Do we commit suicide in order to escape the absence of meaning (the result of despair)? Or do we embrace the absurdity implicit in an absence of meaning without accepting it (revolt)?

For Camus, we long for meaning. Yet, we don't readily find it. Partly because it isn't there. The absurd is born of ""the confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world"".

Quotes from the book:

> ""The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.""

> ""There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest – whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories – comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.""

> ""In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.""

An Uber driver gave me one star because we were discussing politics and were talking about Modi's failures,12,d0tau4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0tau4/an_uber_driver_gave_me_one_star_because_we_were/,27,2019-09-07 21:30:44,"Edit: I know, who cares about uber rating. Honestly this is a non issue but it just hit a nerve with me.

This is crazy right, but I was booking an Uber today and noticed that my rating had dropped from 5 star to 4.4 star which was surprising. I am always a very courteous person and I don't remember anything happening. My last ride was a routine 15 minute ride from office to home, me and my friend actually waited on the road for the uber driver while we could see him down the road buying gutka. Then nothing happened, we got in, 13 minutes later he dropped us off, I thank him and get off.

The only thing that happened was that me and my friend were talking about the recent slowdown and how little Modi's policies have done to help the situation. The whole time I noticed the drive giving us weird looks in the back mirror but I didn't really think about it much you know.

I don't know why this has pissed me off so much but it has. Uber support is so bad that I cannot even send them a message to clarify what happened. 

Fact is, people like him is why Modi won in a landslide and even when he is failing spectacularly, no one can speak negatively about him. I'm disgusted and absolutely livid.

btw this is my second uber account as my older account was linked to my US phone number and I had to make a new account when I moved to India. On that I had a 4.98 rating with the only negative rating being my birthday night where I was very drunk and don't really remember what happened.",0.59,False

I wanted to find out the best option to buy a RE Interceptor 650 on EMIs. I'm sure the showroom has finance companies offering decent rates, but i want to know if anyone know of any finance company or bank that gives a better deal than the showroom.

My dad's retiring at the end of this month, and he mentioned (kinda late) that he wants to buy a RE Interceptor 650 as a retirement present to himself. So I figured I'd surprise him with one. 

I did some digging around and found out that there is like a 1 year wait period for the bike. Anyway that part is out of my hands. I can at least surprise him with a receipt, and he'd be ok waiting out the year.

The footballs I speak of, were made of a synthetic rubber composite called polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These footballs were constructed exactly like a vulcanized rubber football ( molded ), but made of synthetic rubber. They were only in production from approximately 1965 up to 1984. I was not uncommon for these football to have been used in football clubs or leagues, and many were matched use. because I'm only collecting them, I do not care if footballs are damaged (from match use), excessively worn, does not retain air, etc. If you have one, or know someone that does, either reply or send me a private message.",1.0,False

Unpopular Opinion: Honda Activa Sucks!!,4,d0kzbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0kzbq/unpopular_opinion_honda_activa_sucks/,11,2019-09-07 08:32:18,"Hi,

I am one of those people who were always Bus, Metro, Rapido, Uber until it became super inconvenient. Now, I do know how to ride a gearless vehicle(duh just need to balance it). I used ""Bounce"" for a while mostly drove TVS Zest, Jupiter at times. They dropped some new vehicles near Mahadevpura, not sure if that was the reason but for small commutes like searching for a house etc they felt super comfy I never filled fuel cause it never went below half tank even after riding for close to 17km on some days.

Now after a while even ""Bounce"" was not very handy so rented a vehicle from Drivezy it was a Honda Activa. After using it for close to 30 days I am not sure why people recommend it so much :|

Highest selling vehicles bla bla I just don't get the hype surrounding it....

The vehicle I rented from Drivezy is also sort of new just 2300Km so far ""BUT""

either the fuel gauge is fucked up or vehicle has some issue but I feel mileage is pathetic like 15-20Km per litre max

Not too mention the super fuck all/non-existent suspension. After driving for 30Km just a few days back, I am having lower back pain. It's like the back or front wheel suspension is not adequate enough for the holes or speed breakers.

The back suspension almost seems non-existent.

I didn't realise how bad the suspension was until I hitched a ride on my friends Royal Enfield bullet, same road etc but felt comfier. After posting here on Reddit and watching a few youtube videos it seems every Honda Scooter has shit suspension.

So why do people recommend Honda so much??

SideNote:

For me, suspension/comfort/ride quality is very important any scooters or heck which bike will be easy for beginner coming from gearless scooters?

People have suggested TVS NTorq, Suzuki Access as having better suspension can anyone confirm this?

Also, people who switched to a bike from gearless scooters, can you comment on the level of comfort.",0.64,False

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start.

Although currently I don't see something like that happening today, I don't want to sit quietly now and then regret for not taking action(if history repeats)

The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit:**

Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full.

I was also recently rejected twice by the same guy and am not quite over him. This maybe the rejection talking, but an arranged marriage doesn't sound like the worst idea.

I can handle the family pressure, I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about screwing up big time in the future and not having a safety net to fall back on.

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words.

The video was a side-by-side comparison of Ravish Kumar's take on the 2013 and 2019 economic growth in which he is shown criticizing the current government, while in the video from 2013 he questions whether we are worrying too much as very few nations are growing at 5% rate.

I'm sure a lot of you must have also seen that video. So I searched on youtube and found a [6 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8oG2AeArKE&t=) where he's talking about the growth rate of 2013.

My maid whose parents were affected by the Bihar Floods revealed something,522,d0dfsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0dfsc/my_maid_whose_parents_were_affected_by_the_bihar/,122,2019-09-06 21:01:48,"So her parents were caught neck-deep in the flood (I knew this back when it happened), and their mud house was in tatters. All the grain and pulses that they had stored which was also their only source of income for the year was washed away. These people pretty much lived hand-to-mouth, and while they survived the flood, they had nothing left and my maid had to send money to them. 

The CM's ""Relief Fund"" was supposed to relieve the miseries of those who lost their homes and livelihood. My maid said those who suffered the death of breadwinners in the family were supposed to get 1 lakh as compensation, and those who suffered other losses were to get 6000/- per head, but only if they had their Aadhar Card. As her parents had not lost their lives, they were not entitled to the higher sum, but having Aadhar Cards, ""they should get 12,000/-,"" is what she told me back then.

As it turns out, today she tells me after conversing with them this morning, ""only the *sarpanch/pramukh, zamindar* and other *pucca-ghar* influentials of her village have received full compensation few weeks back. My parents and other old couples living by themselves have received nothing."" ""But they are Aadhared for life(!),"" I thought to myself, and then she goes on, ""if my parents still had a son (she lost her brothers four years back), they would have at least received some 'hush-money' from the influentials, as their neighbors did. With no one to retaliate from her family, they feel no obligation to pay. This is how it is in the village. the village heads control everything."" 

Why am I not surprised? It doesn't matter what law the government enforces, it doesn't matter what rhetorics our politicians babble from their high castles, in this country, on the ground-level, only the middle-men rule on a day-to-day basis and there is no accountability of these government representatives who actually deal with the ordinary citizens directly. Be it a cop or the bloke behind a counter. I am sure the person who 'passed the buck' to the village headman also took a nice cut.

A 'Certifiable' Dampener: The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting wants certification of online viewing content.,71,d0d78z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0d78z/a_certifiable_dampener_the_ministry_of/,18,2019-09-06 20:32:36," 

https://i.redd.it/ll9d37u1axk31.png

In a press release by the Press Information Bureau on August 31, 2019, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) invited suggestions for the certification of online viewing content (yes, this means Netflix, Amazon Prime and many others). This is an issue that has been a part of self-censorship code discussions and even court litigations which have been dismissed owing to the positive stance taken by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the matter.

Therefore, in light of this invitation put out by the MIB, we have written a representation with a few suggestions and concerns on establishing methods of certification of online video content:

1. Open consultation: With no formal communication of a consultation, we have requested the Ministry that any consultation to take place, be conducted with transparency and open to public feedback.
2. Concerns on the case being sub-judice: The issue had been previously disposed off by the Delhi High Court in the W.P. (C) 1164/2018; the reasoning used by the Court has also been basis of dismissal in other cases (W.P. (C) No. 7123/2018). As we mentioned in [**our previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/), the Delhi High Court had re-iterated the adequacy of the Information Technology Act, 2000 especially in light of the affidavits filed by both the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. We also mentioned how any change in policy as per the introduction of certification might impact the pre-existing stand of government departments in an active litigation.
3. Censorship and effect on Freedom of Speech: We have expressed the harmful effect on the freedom of speech and expression, innovation and user choice and also referenced our concerns submitted earlier on the 'Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers' by the Internet and Mobile Association of India.

Our continuing concerns are on the resulting large-scale censorship that will ensue. This will impact curator and user freedoms creating a similar practice to the current film and television broadcast industry. It is the diversity, creativity and artistry portrayed through the online viewing platforms that a growing number of Indians prefer the this booming medium of choice.

We continue to suggest that the existing concerns that imply censorship through certification as a solution can be adequately addressed by market based mechanisms and existing penal provisions which are in any instance harsh and contemplate long jail terms on conviction. As always, IFF will continue to advocate for the Freedom of Speech and the facility to create artistic and innovative content for curators and also the ability to enjoy the same by enthusiatic users.

I think this is harming the image of indians around the world and also slowing the development of india and technological innovations in our country. 

So what can be about this? How can we boost scientifc temper, technical skills, critical thinking skills in india?

It seems like our education system is to be blamed. This system of rote learning and mugging up ncert questions to get good marks is bad, something which needs to be stopped. But what can we do?

I have been googling about safety harnesses for my dad, but it's confusing since I haven't got any clue about such things.

He is a retired engineer and a manager and just can't for the life of him take it slow and do nothing. Basically he does all kinds of works at home. Like painting(the whole Damn house), fixing water tank, electrical, polishing all the furnitures, plumbing, welding and truss work etc etc. 

The problem is that he end up being at very tall places with no safety whatsoever and it scares the shit out of me. I simply end up scolding him and point out his age (50+). But it changes nothing. 

So I was thinking about buying him safety harnesses and quick googling/Amazon searched showed me lot of options. But are these 1000-2000 Rs harnesses good enough? Some of it looks flimsy and not many people have bought it. I really don't wanna buy him crap and give him false sense of safety either.

Highlights on Ravish Kumar's speech when receiving the Magsaysay in Manila,475,d0a5zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0a5zj/highlights_on_ravish_kumars_speech_when_receiving/,101,2019-09-06 15:21:11,"**Here are the highlights of Ravish Kumar's public lecture in Manila, the Philippines:**

* India  has conquered the moon. In this very proud moment, I am looking at the  moon and at the ground beneath my feet simultaneously. My streets have  craters and potholes which outnumber the moon.
* Across the world,  democracies on fire in broad daylight are craving the coolness of the  moon. But this fire can only by doused with information that is pure and  with courage, not by mere rhetoric. The more pure our information, the  deeper the trust within our citizenry.
* Two months ago, I was  working on my daily broadcast in my corner office when I received a call  on my cell phone. The caller ID flashed an unknown international number  from the Philippines. I was certain it was a troll calling. For some  reason, a lot of my troll calling traffic comes from the Philippines. If  they are all indeed living in Philippines then I'd like to take this  opportunity to welcome them. I am here now.
* I have received  thousands of calls from trolls in my life but never from a woman. I  quickly shut off the speaker and put the phone against my ear. In  sophisticated English, the woman informed me that I won the Ramon  Magasaysay Award, 2019.
* Flash forward to when I'm here with you.  I am not here alone. I have brought the entire world of Hindi  journalism practised by Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi and Peer Munis  Mohammad.
* Coming to the topic of the day. We are living in  testing times, as journalists and as common citizens. Our citizenship  itself is on trial right now and make no mistake about it, we need to  fight back. We need to rethink our duties and responsibilities as  citizens.
* I believe that in today's times when the attack on our  citizenship is all-encompassing and the state's surveillance apparatus  is more overbearing than ever, the individuals or groups who are able to  withstand this onslaught and emerge stronger from it, will be the ones  who lay the foundation for a better citizenry and for that matter, maybe  even better governments in the future.
* Our world is filled with  such determined citizens already who in spite of pervasive hatred and a  manufactured information deficit, have chosen to fight back and bloom  like the cactus flower does in the midst of a barren hopeless desert.
* Citizenship  effectively requires a free flow of verifiable information. The state  today has established full control over the media and the corporations.  The implication of this control over the media and in turn your  information flow is that it limits and narrows the scope of your  citizenship.
* News channel debates take place within a vocabulary  of exclusionary nationalism wherein they seek to replace the collective  history and memory of the nation with that of the ruling party's in  their viewers' minds
* There are only two types of people in this  news universe narrative: the anti-nationals and us. It's the classic  ""us"" and ""them"" technique. They tell us that the problem with  Anti-nationals is that they ask questions, disagree, and dissent.
* Disagreement is the *atma* \[spirit, soul, or essence\] of democracy and citizenship. The democratic *atma*  is under relentless attack every day. When citizenship is under threat  or when its very meaning has been altered, then what happens to the  nature of a citizen's journalism?
* There are many countries in  the world where this regime, which co-opts the judiciary too, has gained  legitimacy amongst people. And yet, when we see what's happening in  Hong Kong and in Kashmir, you realise that people are still out there  fighting for their citizenship.
* The citizens of Hong Kong have  challenged the government's effort to render citizenship hollow by  refashioning objects of control into devices of liberation.  The  citizens of Hong Kong were willing and able to extricate themselves from  the authoritarian network of information. This tells us that the state  has not yet defeated citizenship.
* Kashmir is another story. An  information and communication blackout imposed for several weeks. More  than 10 million people cut off from any information trade whatsoever.  There was an internet shutdown. Mobiles were rendered useless.
* It  is an unfortunate coincidence that most of India's neighbours are also  its neighbours on the press freedom index. India, Pakistan, China, Sri  Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar - all fall within 50 ranks of each other,  right at the bottom of the international press freedom index released by  reporters without borders.
* A few days ago, going through my  Twitter feed, I encountered a notification issued by the Pakistani  electronic media regulatory authority which gave clear directions to the  country's news channels on reporting the situation in Kashmir.
* It  was specific to the extent of recommending the use of only black and  white colours on TV channel logos on the15th, which happens to be  India's Independence Day.
* I wonder how Pakistani news channels  managed to work on the 15th with such a limited colour spectrum, since  closer home in India, I cannot imagine Indian TV channels to run their  logos and graphics in less than 10 colours and shapes at any given point  in the day.

We have ageing parents and every time I bring up the topic of taking care of them, he starts avoiding it. He says he doesn't know what to do. The thing is, even I want to explore life abroad. I feel somewhat agitated and restless that he is able to live abroad **because** I still live in India and and check on our parents. I feel I'm being used unwittingly. He hasn't said anything like that, but I think he got lucky by moving abroad first leaving me with the burden of being the last child to leave. He is not going to think about our how to take care of our parents as long as I am here. I just want us to work on this problem together.

Meanwhile, every tom dick and harry in my friends circle has moved abroad which makes me feel inadequate.

"Are there any ""alternative schools/education"" in India?",13,d05ejl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d05ejl/are_there_any_alternative_schoolseducation_in/,1,2019-09-06 08:49:09,"I'm an American of Indian origin. I was born, grew up, and went to public school in the U.S. I had issues with some of the schools. I often felt my time was being wasted, and I ended up teaching myself everything - the value-added of 9 out of 10 of my teachers was close to zero. At one point, I unsuccessfully attempted to persuade my parents to allow me to drop out of high school, get a GED (equivalent of 12th exam), and learn a trade (e.g. carpentry/plumbing).

Nevertheless, I've done pretty well for myself. In the American education system, you get second (and third and fourth) chances. There's opportunities in a variety of fields. Access to opportunities is not determined by centralized examination systems, which, in my view, seem to create a race-to-the-bottom. There is rigidity in some aspects of American education, but if you're independent, and can think out of the box, you can find ways to get around the rigidity.

The Indian education system seems like the Cold War. Instead of the USSR and US wasting resources on nuclear weapons, proxy wars, and oversized defense budgets, you have millions of students wasting their youth studying for mentally draining exams through which they learn little which improves their future productivity. Their mental health suffers immensely, and they often have stunted social development. Creative, independent-thinking kids get natural curiosity stamped out of them by parents and society which punishes deviation from *the single path* to a good life.

I see the suffering and hopelessness second-hand in some of my cousins in India, and I wonder what my life would have been like if I was born in India. There were crossroads in my parents' lives where they were considering moving back to India, so I could easily have been raised or even born in India. There are things I prefer about India to the U.S., but knowing my personality, I think I would have been made miserable by the Indian education system.

Something I've begun to think about is whether there are any potential alternative tracks for Indian students who have support from their parents in pursuing those alternative tracks. In particular, since the market for many goods and services is global, a well-trained but *poorly certified* Indian student should be capable with high probability of achieving a significant income through a freelancing career, or by starting his/her own business. So, if you could convince some group of parents to agree, there should be scope for secondary schooling which looks something like this:

- Classes whose material is determined by what is useful for students for developing an independent career
- Explicit teaching of *soft skills* which (I think) are largely ignored by standard Indian education: e.g. communication ability, interviewing, networking, creating a website, writing effective proposals on freelancing platforms
- Teaching of basics like mathematics, reading, writing, history, etc., but with partial or complete ignorance of teaching to the standardized 10th/12th exams, and a great emphasis on developing critical thinking skills.
- Partnership with firms and small businesses to create apprenticeship-type positions, and communication with the firms to understand their needs so that students are well-prepared for those internships
- Teaching of financial prudence, saving, investing, etc.
- Teaching of the laws, regulations, and practicalities of the Indian business environment

This type of model would work for some kinds of potential professions, but not all professions. You could be a programmer, statistician, graphic designer, or a garments exporter, but you couldn't join a profession which requires certification: doctor, chartered accountant, engineer. However, it seems reasonable to me that you could take an average to decent student at the age of 13, remove all the wasted time/resources in education, and in 5-7 years, created a fully capable freelancer/entrepreneur making decent money.

**Questions**

- Are there any such schools/initiatives/forms of education already out there in India similar to what I described?
- Have you met parents (or are you a parent) who strike you as being potentially amenable to such a system?
- What flaws/concerns would you have with the viability of such a system?",1.0,False

Pessimism and existentialism over the government and economy,15,czx5io,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czx5io/pessimism_and_existentialism_over_the_government/,3,2019-09-05 20:08:39,"Reddit is an exclusive and a fairly rational community to express this. We understand how the government stoops new lows day by day and it's just astonishing how people continue to vote for them and most importantly, not see through their lies, even the people who aren't particularly impressed by the government. They just go on to say ""If not Modi, then who?"" The government's manipulative media houses and IT cell know how to hide its flaws and not bring the truth to the limelight.

Because of this, people generally aren't aware of the intensity of atrocities taking place under their ""governance"" and the kind of things their own party members support. Heck, I have good friends who are BJP supporters and I just want to punch them in the face for not having a sense of rationality here. But we just avoid discussing politics and ideologies because some things come first.

And this is the problem. I feel so hopeless and sad about the state of affairs of the country and the radicalism portrayed by the government. It puts me an existential loop, because I feel like nobody wants to believe the truth anymore and irreparable damage has already been done. Even if I work hard, it's because of people like this, there's no place for sincerity and a fight for justice. I can point out a million atrocities committed by them. It's to the point I fear being close to people who are one way or other supporters of BJP. 

It's the same story almost all other major countries of the world. Retarded world leaders and polarized, radical views.

If all of the rules are followed, there’s absolutely no way you can be issued a challan or even try be asked for a bribe.

Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",0.94,False

Why do we have GST and customs duty on semiconductor ?

IMO, having this customs duty on these chips is just making electronics manufacturing more and more difficult.

For my personal project: I had to import every damn chip, And had to pay customs duty + GST + shipping cost.

How the hell innovators are going to work in this environment. Cost of prototyping can be half if I were US ! Especially when you talk about Make\_in\_India. Aren't you supposed to take care of the innovators and startups ?

So don't judge me if I screwed big time.

&#x200B;

The premise is that I did a remote internship with a US-based firm, who recently contacted me to discuss the transfer of my stipend funds. The transaction is to be carried out using wire transfer, and I was asked the bank account name and address, IFSC code, my bank's SWIFT code and my IBAN number. Now, the thing is that my bank (HDFC) doesn't have IBAN numbers; apparently, that's not how banks operate here in India. I contacted my bank about the details of the process, and the bank told me to convey some additional information to the firm I worked with, which included beneficiary's (mine) name, beneficiary's account number, beneficiary bank's name, beneficiary bank's SWIFT code (already given), correspondent bank's name, correspondent bank's SWIFT code, Account number held with correspondent bank, CHIPS ABA, FEDWIRE ABA and CHIPS UID, whatever those words mean.

&#x200B;

Now, this is the problem. In the field for the beneficiary's bank name, I repeat, the beneficiary's BANK NAME, I filled out the entire bank name and address with the fucking pin-code and everything. It just struck me, after I had sent out the information, that I misinterpreted what was being asked, and on further googling the issue, I find articles telling me that if the details don't match letter-for-letter, the entire transaction may be cancelled and they may have to pay a fine for it as well, which will obviously be deducted from my stipend, and now I'm panicking.

My career is ruined.,27,cznj3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cznj3t/my_career_is_ruined/,39,2019-09-05 06:25:20,"EDIT: Case closed. I am giving few months of try with 3D. Those who helped, thanks a lot.

Few details are changed. I am 28 and belongs to an upper-middle class family in Delhi.

Basically I am very confused and depressed about my career path. I have a long story but I will keep it very short.

I am pursuing 3d modeling on my own and doing good at it as what the community tells me. Lately I am seeing all these threads on animation and VFX industry being shit. Like how they make you work for long hours and the pay not being good enough. I wonder if things are same for 3D modeling or not. Indians working in such positions are very hard to find online.

I have done [B.Com](https://B.Com) from DU and that's it. I completed it in 2014 after a few attempts and I haven't had a job since graduation. I tried for government job but I failed there. I also tried for CAT and only scored 65% percentile. I am learning modeling for almost 3 years (3 complete years this December). I love modeling, but I am already 28 with no job and poor qualification. I know I messed up my life.

Suddenly I am sad (thinking about friends all doing decent jobs and I am stuck here with no job and future) and then I am happy (knowing I am doing good). This happens quite a few times in a  day. I get very sad at night thinking of not waking up tomorrow. When I picked 3D modeling, I thought the industry has good pay and less work hours. I had a plan of working for clients and not doing those 14 hours a day work at agencies. I have heard freelancing is tough.

I don't have a clue of what I should do. Should I get a full time job or keep pursuing 3D modeling?  I am very depressed over this.

However that changed after I got it installed and running today. Basically the router is locked down. You can't use non Jio routers to connect, there's no username / password settings to use for another non Jio router.

The biggest security issue is your Jio router can be managed by my Jio app like changing SSID, password, blocking device etc and it works even remotely (outside your WiFi network). So the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which I'm sure can be cracked. Moreover if they get access to network from Jio side, they can literally do anything. Run exploits against your networked devices etc.

And remote management is disabled by default so there's no way to stop myjio app access.

Two months ago, her roka was done forcefully, and now, she has been sent off by her parents to her grandpa's place in Chennai. Grandpa is a crorepati and very influential.  


Yesterday, my girlfriend was forcefully taken to the Surat airport via the VIP route straight to the aircraft and boarded directly just a minute before the departure. Her parents and grandpa had arranged some document from Chennai giving them complete control over her life even though she's 18+. Some top-level cop from Chennai had come to Surat to take her forcefully to her grandpa's place in Chennai. She called local cops before being dragged into the car to be sent off to the airport, and they left without any help just a minute after arriving. The Chennai-based cop showed the document to the local cops and left with my gf to take her to Chennai in a snap. She was beaten up by her mother in front of the whole building for calling cops and sent off to the airport along with this Chennai-based cop.

Her family has filed fake cases on me that I have done some black magic on her, I am going to rape her, I am going to runaway with her, etc to frame me if I try to help, although I do not fear any repercussions as long as my gf gets her freedom and justice. How do I help her now? She has been beaten up a lot over the last 3-4 months, and her phone has been taken away from her. She's being held captive at grandpa's place in Chennai. When she was in Surat, private detectives were kept to follow her and her room was bugged. She could not make a move without her evil family knowing.  


Our women's commissions are unfortunately too weak and fail to put force on corrupt police forces to provide any legal aid to victims. I have seen many cases go wrong when these commissions get involved but do nothing. Even 181/1091 was useless. Lady cops came to 'counsel' parents - what were they thinking?

With this a small group, 4 persons is going there for the marriage and we will take advantage to go to India. It will be the first time for everyone of us.

So we are planning to do a Golden Triangle tour - Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, for 7 days (6 nights), before going to the wedding (3 days 3 nights) and then head south to Goa, for a week.

Now, I'm having some hard time planning this. I was looking for a tour, because it could take us to all the major points, and helpfully having a nice guide will give cultural and historical inputs that we want. I got some few quotations from different tour operators and narrowed my search to 3 - Creative India Tours - https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297683-d12310857-Reviews-Creative_India_Holidays-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html

Agra day tour packages - https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d5789057-Reviews-Agra_Day_Tour_Packages-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html

Indian Holidays pvt - https://www.indianholiday.com/

The first one has a slightly better price, about 365 USD per person, but it has the least reviews and lately it got a very poor review, saying they were taken to restaurants with much more expensive food, taken to a lot of shops they didn't want, etc.

The other 2 cost about 390USD per person, the Indian Holidays Pvt. although being a big company, they don't have a trip advisor reviews page, so I don't know if I can rely on the reviews on their website.

Agra day tour packages seems the best pick, with over 1500 reviews on trip advisor and just 14 with 3 stars or less. Still there are some people saying they were taken to shops they didn't want while missing some of the sightseeing. Yet these guys belong to IATO, that seems to be a government recognition of Tour operators in India. So it seems more reliable than the others.

I'd like some input here, what to do to not lose time in stupid shops, not lose money with inflated prices and mostly to not lose important places for things we don't want to do (and are not in the places to visit in the quotation given). We would like however to shop, for some clothes in the first day, since we don't have the clothing to attend the marriage. Where would it be good to buy some clothes (for a decent price, nothing super expensive), again, without being ripped off.

On the second part of the trip going to Goa, we are thinking of staying in Candolim, to enjoy the beach and some bars. We would still like to go to south Goa to see the historical and cultural places too and to Dudhsagar waterfalls. The waterfalls probably we could get a full day taxi, just drop us there, we would do some hiking, it would be nice. For the sightseeing we could also book a tour, but I think the costs I got (250 USD), for essentially 2 days sightseeing and take us from the airport to the hotel and back to the airport is expensive. Can we just get a taxi maybe to show us around or maybe locally some guide?

Also for our stay we would like to rent some motor bikes, is there any website for it? That we could do and is trustworthy?

Kashmiri student based in Bangalore files petition before the Karnataka HC against communication shutdown,121,czgkia,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czgkia/kashmiri_student_based_in_bangalore_files/,43,2019-09-04 18:56:04,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qkfwmyh0jik31.png

**September 04, 2019:** It has almost been one month since the Central Government imposed a complete communication shutdown in Kashmir on 5 August 2019. While restrictions have been eased in the Jammu region, the Kashmir valley continues to remain under clamp down with internet and cellular network services suspended. On 19 August 2019, a young Kashmiri student based in Bangalore moved to the Karnataka High Court to challenge the complete communication blockade as violative of fundamental rights of residents of Kashmir and their loved ones living outside the State.   


The Petitioner was forced to approach the High Court because he had been unable to establish contact with his family members in Kashmir. He was especially worried because many of his family members suffer from various health problems and due to the communication shutdown and strict curfews, it has become difficult to call for help or reach hospitals in time. The Petition argues that the complete communication blockade violates Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of India and it is incompatible with India’s obligations under international human rights law. Most importantly, the Petition highlights that the communication shutdown seems to lack any legal basis because there is no order authorizing the suspension of telecom and internet services which is available in the public domain.   


As a constitutional democracy, what sets India apart is our stated commitment to the rule of law. While imposing such severe and indiscriminate restrictions on an entire community, the Government must at the very least act in a transparent manner. Without access to the legal orders, it is impossible to know under which law the shutdown has been ordered, on what grounds, by which government authority, for what period of time, and whether it has been subjected to any kind of review.  


There have been three hearings in the case so far on 27 August, 30 August and 3 September. The crux of these hearings has been the maintainability of the Petition in light of a similar petition filed by Mr. Tehseen Poonawalla being pending before the Supreme Court. During the hearings, the counsel for the Petitioner has clarified that this case is different because the Petitioner is personally affected by the communication shutdown. Further, High Courts in India have independent and concurrent powers to protect fundamental rights of individuals within their territorial jurisdiction. To us, this is also an access to justice issue because an aggrieved person cannot be compelled to travel all the way to the Supreme Court in Delhi to seek constitutional remedies.  


Internet Freedom Foundation along with Ms. Maansi Verma assisted in drafting the Writ Petition and provided inputs on strategy and policy. The Petition was filed and argued by Mr. Vishwajith Sadanand and Mr. Ravi Varma Kumar and we deeply appreciate their support. While at the moment, IFF does not have the capacity to be a full fledged legal clinic, we do take on this role whenever there is a serious violation of rights of internet users in any part of India. This Petition is part of our larger advocacy against internet shutdowns which are a pan-India problem. Internet shutdowns cause great hardships because ordinary people cannot access many government benefits and essential services such as banking without the internet. In today’s digitized world, the internet cannot be considered a luxury, and access to the internet is a fundamental right and any restrictions on it must be subjected to constitutional scrutiny.

In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,15,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,4,2019-09-04 16:57:42,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",0.85,False

After that I travelled in South East Asia for 2 weeks about a year ago so that my passport has at least one stamp. Now I am employed(first job) since last 7 months(I don't have an ITR document , i joined in the last month of FY). 

**I am planning to apply through Spain(9% rejection rate) or Nederlands also high rejection rate.** 

Now guys i need your **help and tips so that i could avoid Visa refusal again**.
